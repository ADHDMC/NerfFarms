#Nerf Farms Plugin
#This plugin is intended to allow server owners to have more control over what types of mob farms their players can use.
#For the purposes of this plugin, these rules will, by default, apply to mobs not killed by a player/player's pet. (Fall damage, crushing, drowning)
#Additional config options are listed below.
